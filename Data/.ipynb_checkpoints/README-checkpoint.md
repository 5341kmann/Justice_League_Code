# Overview of Data Organization

In analyzing these simulations, I used bulk processing scripts (see `../BulkProcessing/`) to compile datasets of satellite properties. This minimizes the computational effort required to do some basic analysis. These compiled datasets are stored in `.data` files. 

## Redshift Zero Datasets

The first iteration of datasets are those from the redshift zero snapshot.
