# Timesteps Data

*Note: If you're viewing this directory on the remote Github repository, you will notice there is no data here. This is because the files are too large to store on Github. However, if you clone this repo and want the scripts/notebooks to work, you will need to have the timesteps data available. Thus, you can download the four `hXXX.data` files [from Dropbox](I_STILL_NEED_TO_ADD_A_LINK) and place them in this directory.
