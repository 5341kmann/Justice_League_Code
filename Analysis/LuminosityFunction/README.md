# Luminosity Function

*Notebook: `LumFunction_F19.ipynb`.*

The code in this notebook is used to generate the satellite luminosity functions (Akins et al 2020, fig 2) of the Justice League satellite systems. 

*Notebook: `Lum_Mass_Occupation.ipynb`.*

The code in this notebook is used to generate satellite LFs, mass functions, and occupation fractions (the fraction of DM halos that are occupied by stellar disks). 

## Data used

Luminosity functions are generated from the redshift 0 dataset generated from 2019/11/29.
